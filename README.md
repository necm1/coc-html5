## Clash of Clans HTML5

A simple attempt to replicate the isometric view of Clash of Clans using PixiJS. It also includes an asset extractor for “.sc” files. Unfortunately, I’m not sure whether MovieClips were extracted as well, but Shapes and Regions work.

In PixiJS, the “asset-manager” package is used to assemble the individual Regions into a Shape. The “core” package contains the relatively simple logic for the world, camera, and background elements.

I should mention that the isometric implementation and rendering of the world is still faulty. Sadly, the changes were made quite some time ago, and I can’t recall all the individual steps anymore.
